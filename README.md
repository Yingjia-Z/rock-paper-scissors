# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project implements an adaptive agent that plays Rock-Paper-Scissors against various opponents using different strategies, from naive to complex. 

Developed with the OpenSpiel framework to support advanced reinforcement learning and game planning, this agent excels in pattern recognition by maintaining a record of the opponent’s last ten actions. 

This capability enables it to detect patterns and predict future moves, targeting a **93% win rate**. See the the [Strategy](Strategy%20of%20MyAgent.pdf) file for a detailed discussion on the agent's strategies.
